# Advent-of-code-Solutions
This is a repository where I collect all my Advent of Code Solutions from the past years.

Hello! I'm a student from DCSPD that has a strong passion in electrical engineering and programming. I do Advent of Code annually as a fun activity (also just to practice my skills). My coding skills are not very up to scratch but at least they get the job done. (I hope there's no bugs.) I try to make my solutions as easy to follow as possible (not using a lot of mnemonics and symbols). Please refer to these if you need to.

Have fun coding!
