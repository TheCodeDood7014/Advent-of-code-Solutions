# Advent-of-code-Solutions
This is a repository where I collect all my Advent of Code Solutions from the past years.

My coding skills are not very up to scratch but at least they get the job done. (I hope there's no bugs.) I try to make my solutions as easy to follow as possible (not using a lot of mnemonics and symbols). Please refer to these if you need to.

Have fun coding!
